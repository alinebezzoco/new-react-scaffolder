# new-react-scaffolder 

Scaffolding tool for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). 
Updated to 16 React version.

This is a forked project by [99xt](https://github.com/99xt) and the original project is [here](https://github.com/99xt/react-scaffolder). 
I updated the dependency to new React version and I made some changes.  

## About the plugin
react-scaffolder is a command line interface which brings smooth developer experience (DX) for React devs. react-scaffolder provides a better way to generate react projects with [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/99xt/react-boilerplate). With this tool it's possible to continue generating boilerplate code with heavy customizations once a project is initiated. 

## What's new 
* You don't need to use the `.reactclirc` to generate a new component in an existing project; 
* Use package.json to run the project; 
* React updated to 16 version; 
* Component generate (parent or child) updated to the new React version; 

## Quick start 
For install the dependency, please follow this steps: 

* Clone this project; 
* Open project folder `cd new-react-scaffolder` and run this command: 

```
$ npm pack
```

* When you finish generating the package, run this command: 

```
sudo npm install -g react-scaffolder-0.3.3.tgz
```
